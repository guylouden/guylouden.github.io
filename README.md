# personal_website_2019

This is where I work on my personal website. It is hosted here on github, and I push edits straight online to https://guylouden.github.io/2019/, which is just redirected from my domain at www.guylouden.com/.

Eventually I'd love to host this all myself from home. I'm really interested in low-tech mag's solar power server project (https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html), and this is what I'll work towards in the longer term.
